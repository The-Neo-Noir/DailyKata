<p>
Return the sum of the numbers in the array, returning 0 for an empty array. Except the number 13 is very unlucky, so it does not count and numbers that come immediately after occurance of 13 also do not count.
</p>

sum13([1, 2, 2, 1]) → 6 <br>
sum13([1, 1]) → 2</br>
sum13([1, 2, 2, 1, 13]) → 6<br>
