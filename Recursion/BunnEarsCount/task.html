<p>
    We have bunnies standing in a line, numbered 1, 2, ... The odd bunnies (1, 3, ..) have the normal 2 ears. The even bunnies (2, 4, ..) we'll say have 3 ears, because they each have a raised foot. Recursively return the number of "ears" in the bunny line 1, 2, ... n (without loops or multiplication).

    bunnyEars2(0) → 0 <br>
    bunnyEars2(1) → 2 <br>
    bunnyEars2(2) → 5 <br>
