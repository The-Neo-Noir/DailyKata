<p>We have triangle made of blocks. The topmost row has 1 block, the next row down has 2 blocks, the next row has 3 blocks, and so on. Compute recursively (no loops or multiplication) the total number of blocks in such a triangle with the given number of rows.
</p>

    triangle(0) → 0<br>
    triangle(1) → 1<br>
    triangle(2) → 3<br>
